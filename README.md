This repository hosts all my code from my Summer 2024 research project in Astrophysics. 

## Project Description: 

In the 1990's, there were several studies conducted where they found that the X-ray and the Radio positions of an [X-ray binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_binary) located at the very core of the Globular Cluster Terzan 1 did not match. Terzan 1, located 22,000 light years away, is a globular cluster in the Milky Way Galaxy. 

In this project, I undertook the responsibility to analyse archival observations [Very Large Array (VLA)](https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/vla/) to correctly characterise the compact object population in this globular cluster.
