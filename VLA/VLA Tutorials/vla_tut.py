# VLA 5 GHz continuum survey of Seyfert galaxies 6.4.1
# We are using the sruvey AG733, which consists of observations of a handful of Seyfert galaxies (host to quasars)

# Our data for the old project has already been installed by Alex into this mac
# The whole project has been divided into steps

# 1. Importing from the VLA Archive and Preliminary Data Inspection
# We do not need to worry much about importing the data as it has already been installed. # Check Background information page to learn about some basic commands to work on the terinal

# Changing our directory to get the data
cd AG733

# To import the data in Casa, we use `importvla` command. Import VLA as in Very Large Array. So we use this command to import the vla data into a measurement set format that CASA can
# work with.
# In Casa, to get rid of any original version of the measurement set, we do
if os.path.exists('ag733.ms'): rmtables('ag733.ms')
# We do this to ensure that there is no conflict with any pre-existing data before importing the new data


importvla(archivefiles=['AG733_1_54078.16663_54078.27045.exp'],vis='ag733.ms')
# archivefiles: Name of input VLA archive file(s)
# 22-05-24: We tried using the import vla task but for some reason it does not work and gives the warning
#that all elements of the vector parameter must be a path that exists (at least one element of "['AG733_1_54078.16663_54078.27045.exp']" does not exist)
# We have sought alex's helpf
# 23-05-24: Okay, so it wasn't any problem. The thing was that we were working in the ag733.ms directory and we don't want to do that, ever, ever, ever.
# We always have to work with AG733 directory.

listobs('ag733.ms') 
# This will provide a list of scans, sources and their respective indices and antennas.

vishead('ag733.ms')
# This is very similar to what listobs does. But vishead will give a much concise view of the summary.


plotants(vis='ag733.ms', figfile='ag733_plotants.png')
# This will generate a plot of the antenna distribution,ie, the position of the antennae
# and will save it in a file named `ag733_plotants.png`.
# vis: use this to write the name of MS file, which will use the info on the antennas stored in the ms file
# figfile: Save the plotted figure to this file 

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Viewing and Editing the Measurement Set

plotms()
# It brings up a graphical display that allows us to plot various displays of the graph
# In the tutorial, it is used to display the measurement set ag733.ms

# In our tutorial, we find that there is some bad data and we want to flag that. 
# we will use flagdata() to flag them and then we will plot our data again. 
# we note that the data from VA05, VA15 and VA22 are bad.

# flag the first 45 seconds as all antennas were not on the source
flagdata(vis='ag733.ms', timerange='2006/12/09/04:00:00~04:00:45')

# now we flag all the anamolies 
flagdata(vis='ag733.ms', antenna='VA15', timerange='2006/12/09/04:45:10.0~04:45:20.0')
flagdata(vis='ag733.ms', antenna='VA15', timerange='2006/12/09/06:12:30.0~06:14:10.0')
flagdata(vis='ag733.ms', antenna='VA05', timerange='2006/12/09/04:30:00.0~04:30:10.0')
flagdata(vis='ag733.ms', antenna='VA22', timerange='2006/12/09/06:28:10.0~06:28:20.0')
flagdata(vis='ag733.ms', timerange='2006/12/09/06:24:50.0~06:25:00.0')

# Now we plot the data again to see if it looks reasonable.
plotms()
# we made some amazing plots and also took some screenshots of them so that we can ask about them to Alex
# we also want to ask if we can save those plots, somehow.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. Python interlude 

# First we define some variables which store calibrator and source information

# It will also be helpful to have a way of referencing
# which complex gain calibrator should be assigned to which sourse.
# We do so by using a dictionary variable.

# 4. Calibration 

## We set the Flux Density Scale

# this will fill the model column with the visibilities of a calibrator
inp 
# this will show the current and the possibile input parameters
vis = 'ag733.ms'
listmodel=True
go

# From the list of models, we will select 3C38_C.im and tell setjy to use this model and apply it to our observation if 0137+331.
# We will also tell setjy to set the usescratch parameter to True so that the value is written into the MODEL column 

setjy(vis='ag733.ms', field='0137+331', model='3C48_C.im', usescratch=True)
# vis: Name of the input visibility file
# field: we will give this parameter the name of the field
# model: model name
# usescratch: If True: the model visibility will be evaluated and saved on disk in the MODEL_DATA column.

#setjy will return a Python dictionary to the terminal and to the logger. 
# The amplitude value that setjy adjusted the flux density scale calibrator in the MODEL column is ~5.3 Jy for spw 0 and 1. 
# We then plot this by using plotms()''

# Now we determine the Calibration solutions
# At this stage, the data has an overall flux density scaling determined, but full gain solutions aren't there yet. 
# We use the gaincal task which will produce the table cal.G

# Delete any old versions of the calibration tables
# will give warning, but we can ignore it safely

# solint (solution interval) = 'inf', meaning average over entire scans of each calibrator in turn 
# This may not work. use '1min', or '2min'.

# The python dictionary will also contain information about the flux density scaling and other info.

## Splitting the calibrated source data from the multisource measurement set

# to split the calibrated source data out of the measurement set, we use Casa task split()
# So what we are doing here is that we are splitting the calibrated source data from our multisource measurement set
